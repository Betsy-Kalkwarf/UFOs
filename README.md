## Overview
The UFO Sightings website was created to display data from a lot of UFO sightings. First, a table is created to display all the data. Then styling is added to the website to make it more approachable. Finally, a filter feature was added to the website to make the data searchable by date, location (city, state, country), or shape. The assignment also helped me learn more about HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and how they all interact with each other.

## Results
The screenshot below shows how all the data is displayed in a table. You can scroll through all the data about the different UFO sightings.

Looking at all the data at once may be overwhelming. Therefore, I created ways for you to search through the different UFO sightings. You can search by date of the sighting, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO. THe screenshot below shows all the UFO sightings that were reported to be circular in shape.

If you want to see all the sightings that happened in your home state of Oregon, you just input “or” in the state filter. The results are shown below.

You can even search with multiple filters at once. The screenshot below shows sightings in the United States that were with a shape reported as a light.

## Summary
The website full of data is much more approachable when you are able to filter the data by specific date, location, and/or shape. One drawback of this design is how you search by date. Right now you can only search by an exact day. I would recommend that the date feature be searchable by month and year, as well. This way you can see which month(s) have had the most UFO activity. You could also see all the sightings in one year, if the date search were modified. I would also suggest being able to search for a specific word or group of words in the comments.
